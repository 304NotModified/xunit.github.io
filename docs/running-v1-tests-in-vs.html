<h1>Running xUnit.net v1 tests in Visual Studio</h1>

<p class="important"><strong>Important note</strong>: If you've previously installed the xUnit.net Visual Studio Runner VSIX (Extension), you must uninstall it first. The Visual Studio runner is only distributed via NuGet now. To remove it, to go <code>Tools</code> &gt; <code>Extensions and Updates</code>. Scroll to the bottom of the list, and if xUnit.net is installed, uninstall it. This will force you to restart Visual Studio.</p>

<p>If you have Visual Studio Community (or a paid-for version of Visual Studio), you can run your xUnit.net tests within Visual Studio's built-in test runner (named Test Explorer).</p>

<p>Once again, right click on the project in Solution Explorer and choose <code>Manage NuGet Packages</code>. This time, you're going to search for (and install) a package named <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>:</p>

<p>Make sure Test Explorer is visible (go to <code>Test &gt; Windows &gt; Test Explorer</code>). Every time you build your project, the runner will discover unit tests in your project. After a moment of discovery, you should see the list of discovered tests:</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started/test-explorer.png" width="330" /></p>

<p>Click the <code>Run All</code> link in the Test Explorer window, and you should see the results update in the Test Explorer window as the tests are run:</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started/test-explorer-post-run.png" width="330" /></p>

<p>You can click on a failed test to see the failure message, and the stack trace. You can click on the stack trace lines to take you directly to the failing line of code.</p>

<p>If you have Visual Studio Ultimate and you have the CodeLens feature turned on, your source code will now show icons and text related to your tests:</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started/code-lens.png" width="224" /></p>

<p>CodeLens not only shows you the last run status of your unit tests, it also offers a convenient place to click to run an individual test.</p>

<p><em>Note: you may have noticed there are no icons for theories, only for facts. This is because Visual Studio does not show icons when there are multiple tests pointing to the same test method. A future version of the xUnit.net plugin for Visual Studio will include a feature to enable CodeLens for theories (which will disable the ability to run individual theory items).</em></p>
