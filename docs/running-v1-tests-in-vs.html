<h1>Running xUnit.net v1 tests in Visual Studio</h1>

<p class="important"><strong>Important note</strong>: If you've previously installed the xUnit.net Visual Studio Runner VSIX (Extension), you must uninstall it first. The Visual Studio runner is only distributed via NuGet now. To remove it, to go <code>Tools</code> &gt; <code>Extensions and Updates</code>. Scroll to the bottom of the list, and if xUnit.net is installed, uninstall it. This will force you to restart Visual Studio.</p>

<p>If you have Visual Studio Community (or a paid-for version of Visual Studio), you can run your xUnit.net tests within Visual Studio's built-in test runner (named Test Explorer).</p>

<p>Right click on the project in Solution Explorer and choose <code>Manage NuGet Packages</code>. Search for (and install) a package named <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>:</p>

<p>Make sure Test Explorer is visible (go to <code>Test &gt; Windows &gt; Test Explorer</code>). Every time you build your project, the runner will discover unit tests in your project. After a moment of discovery, you should see the list of discovered tests:</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started/test-explorer.png" width="330" /></p>

<p>Click the <code>Run All</code> link in the Test Explorer window, and you should see the results update in the Test Explorer window as the tests are run:</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started/test-explorer-post-run.png" width="330" /></p>

<p>You can click on a failed test to see the failure message, and the stack trace. You can click on the stack trace lines to take you directly to the failing line of code.</p>

<p>If you have Visual Studio Ultimate and you have the CodeLens feature turned on, your source code will now show icons and text related to your tests:</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started/code-lens.png" width="224" /></p>

<p>CodeLens not only shows you the last run status of your unit tests, it also offers a convenient place to click to run an individual test.</p>

<p><em>Note: Only xUnit.net v2 supports pre-enumeration of theories; when discovering theories with v1, it will only show a single test method for the theory.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: CodeLens does not support icons for pre-enumerated theories; this is a limitation of the Visual Studio code. In a future release, we will enable the ability to turn off theory pre-enumeration for users who would prefer to have the CodeLens icons rather than individually runnable tests.</em></p>
