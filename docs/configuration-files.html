<h1>Configuring xUnit.net</h1>

<p>
  Configuration files can be used to configure xUnit.net on a per test-assembly basis.
  The simplest way to do this is to add an <code>App.config</code> file to your test
  project, and then add the configuration elements that represent the desired settings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Today, these configuration files are only fully supported for
  Desktop and PCL projects, since they are the only ones that appropriately support
  <code>App.config</code> files. They are supported by the Console, MSBuild, Visual
  Studio, and TestDriven.NET runners. They also have limited impact during discovery
  only for Visual Studio device test projects (Modern Windows, Windows Phone Silverlight,
  and Universal apps).
</p>
<p>
  The configuration elements are placed inside the <code>&lt;appSettings&gt;</code>
  section:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="key-name" value="your-value"/>
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Below is a list of support keys and values:</p>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Supported Values</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>xunit.diagnosticMessages</th>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      <p>
        Set this value to <code>true</code> to include diagnostic information during test
        discovery and execution. Each runner has a unique method of presenting diagnostic
        messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Default value: false<br />
        Supported by: xUnit.net v2</em>
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>xunit.maxParallelThreads</th>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      <p>
        Set this to override the maximum number of threads to be used when parallelizing
        tests within this assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Default value: the number of logical processors in your PC<br />
        Supported by: xUnit.net v2</em>
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>xunit.methodDisplay</th>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      <p>
        Set this to override the default display name for test cases. If you set this
        to <code>method</code>, the display name will be just the method (without the
        class name); if this set this value to <code>classAndMethod</code>, the
        default display name will be the fully qualified class name and method name.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Default value: classAndMethod<br />
        Supported by: xUnit.net v2</em>
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>xunit.parallelizeAssembly</th>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      <p>
        Set this to <code>true</code> if this assembly is willing to participate in
        parallelization with other assemblies. Test runners can use this information to
        automatically enable parallelization across assemblies if all the assemblies
        agree to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Default value: false<br />
        Supported by: xUnit.net v1 and v2</em>
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>xunit.parallelizeTestCollections</th>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      <p>
        Set this to <code>true</code> if the assembly is willing to run tests inside
        this assembly in parallel against each other. Tests in the same test collection
        will be run sequentially against each other, but tests in different test
        collections will be run in parallel against each other. Set this to
        <code>false</code> to disable all parallelization within this test assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Default value: true<br />
        Supported by: xUnit.net v2</em>
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>xunit.preEnumerateTheories</th>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      <p>
        Set this to <code>true</code> to pre-enumerate theories so that there is an
        individual test case for each theory data row. Set this to <code>false</code>
        to return a single test case for each theory without pre-enumerating the
        data ahead of time (this is how xUnit.net v1.x used to behave). This is
        most useful for developers running tests inside Visual Studio, who wish to
        have the Code Lens test runner icons on their theory methods, since Code
        Lens does not support multiple tests from a single method.
      </p>
