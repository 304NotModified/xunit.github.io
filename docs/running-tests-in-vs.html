<h1>Running xUnit.net tests in Visual Studio</h1>

<p class="important">
  <strong>Important note</strong>: If you've previously installed the xUnit.net Visual Studio
  Runner VSIX (Extension), you must uninstall it first. The Visual Studio runner is only distributed
  via NuGet now. To remove it, to go <code>Tools</code> &gt; <code>Extensions and Updates</code>.
  Scroll to the bottom of the list, and if xUnit.net is installed, uninstall it. This will force
  you to restart Visual Studio.
</p>

<p class="important">
  <strong>If you're having problems discovering or running tests,</strong> you may be a victim
  of a corrupted runner cache inside Visual Studio. To clear this cache, shut down all instances
  of Visual Studio, then delete the folder <code>%TEMP%\VisualStudioTestExplorerExtensions</code>.
  Also make sure your project is only linked against a single version of the Visual Studio runner
  NuGet package (<code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>).
</p>

<p>
  If you have Visual Studio Community (or a paid-for version of Visual Studio), you can run your
  xUnit.net tests within Visual Studio's built-in test runner (named Test Explorer). Unfortunately,
  this does not include Express editions of Visual Studio (you should upgrade to the free
  <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx">Community
  Edition</a> instead).
</p>

<p>
  Right click on the project in Solution Explorer and choose <code>Manage NuGet Packages</code>.
  Search for (and install) a package named <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>:

<p>
  Make sure Test Explorer is visible (go to <code>Test &gt; Windows &gt; Test Explorer</code>). Every
  time you build your project, the runner will discover unit tests in your project. After a moment of
  discovery, you should see the list of discovered tests:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started/test-explorer.png" width="330" /></p>

<p>
  Click the <code>Run All</code> link in the Test Explorer window, and you should see the results update
  in the Test Explorer window as the tests are run:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started/test-explorer-post-run.png" width="330" /></p>

<p>
  You can click on a failed test to see the failure message, and the stack trace. You can click on the
  stack trace lines to take you directly to the failing line of code.
</p>

<p>
  If you have Visual Studio Ultimate and you have the CodeLens feature turned on, your source code will
  now show icons and text related to your tests:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started/code-lens.png" width="224" /></p>

<p>
  CodeLens not only shows you the last run status of your unit tests, it also offers a convenient
  place to click to run an individual test.
</p>

<p><em>
  Note: Only xUnit.net v2 supports pre-enumeration of theories; when discovering theories with v1,
  it will only show a single test method for the theory.
</em></p>

<p><em>
  Note: CodeLens does not support icons for pre-enumerated theories; this is a limitation of the Visual
  Studio test runner. In a future release, we will enable the ability to turn off theory pre-enumeration
  of theory data for users who would prefer to have the CodeLens icons rather than individually
  runnable tests.
