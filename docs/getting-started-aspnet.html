<h1>Getting Started with xUnit.net and ASP.NET 5</h1>

<p>
  In this article, we will demonstrate getting started with xUnit.net, showing you
  how to write and run your first set of unit tests.

  numbers and paths may differ for you, depending on which version you're using.

<h2 id="create-class-library">Create a class library project</h2>

<p>
  Let's start by creating a class library project, targeting .NET 4.5 (or later). Ope
  Visual Studio, and choose <code>File &gt; New &gt; Project</code>:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started-aspnet/new-project.png" width="800" /></p>

<h2 id="add-xunit-ref">Add a reference to xUnit.net</h2>

<p>In Solution Explorer, find and open the <code>project.json</code> file:</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../images/getting-started-aspnet/open-project-json.png" width="356" /></p>

<p>
  Add dependencies on the <code>xunit</code> and <code>xunit.runner.aspnet</code> packages, as
  well as the <code>test</code> command, as shown below:
</p>

{% highlight json %}
{
    "dependencies": {
        "xunit": "2.0.0-rc2-*",
        "xunit.runner.aspnet": "2.0.0-rc2-*"
    },
    "commands": {
        "test": "xunit.runner.aspnet"
    },
    "frameworks" : {
        "aspnet50" : {
        },
        "aspnetcore50" : {
            "dependencies": {
                "System.Runtime": "4.0.20-beta-22416"
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="write-first-tests">Write your first tests</h2>

<p>
  When you created the project, Visual Studio automatically created a file named <code>Class1.cs</code>
  and opened it for you. Inside this class, add a couple tests:
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
using Xunit;

namespace MyFirstAspNetUnitTests
{
    public class Class1
    {
        [Fact]
        public void PassingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(4, Add(2, 2));
        }

        [Fact]
        public void FailingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(5, Add(2, 2));
        }

        int Add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Build the solution to ensure that the code compiles. Now that you've written the first
  test, we need a way to run it.
</p>

<h2 id="run-tests">Run tests with the xUnit.net ASP.NET runner</h2>

<p>
  Open a command prompt or PowerShell command window. In the window, navigate to folder
  containing the source code of your test project (this will usually be in a folder below
  the <code>src</code> folder, in your solution folder).
</p>

<p>
  To run the ASP.NET runner, type <code>k test</code>, as shown below:
</p>

<p>
  Now that we've gotten your first unit tests to run, let's introduce one more way to
  write tests: using theories.
</p>

<h2 id="write-first-theory">Write your first theory</h2>

<p>
  You may have wondered why your first unit tests use an attribute named <code>[Fact]</code>
  rather than one with a more traditional name like Test. xUnit.net includes support for
  two different major types of unit tests: facts and theories. When describing the
  difference between facts and theories, we like to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Facts</strong> are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Theories</strong> are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  A good example of this testing numeric algorithms. Let's say you want to test an algorithm
  which determines whether a number is odd or not. If you're writing the positive-side tests
  (odd numbers), then feeding even numbers into the test would cause it fail, and not because
  the test or algorithm is wrong.
</p>

<p>Let's add a theory to our existing facts (including a bit of bad data, so we can see it fail):</p>

{% highlight C# %}
[Theory]
[InlineData(3)]
[InlineData(5)]
[InlineData(6)]
public void MyFirstTheory(int value)
{
    Assert.True(IsOdd(value));
}

bool IsOdd(int value)
{
    return value % 2 == 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This time when we compile and run our tests, we see a second failure, for our theory that was given 6:</p>

<p>
  Although we've only written 3 test methods, the console runner actually ran 5 tests;
  that's because each theory with its data set is a separate test. Note also that the runner
  tells you exactly which set of data failed, because it includes the parameter values in
  the name of the test.
